I am involved in a multi-year study of the Marginal Ice Zone and ice breakup processes in Kotzebue Sound, Arctic Alaska. The winter of 2017-2018 saw an extremely anomalous year for ice formation in the Sound, with the Native community of Kotzebue reporting that it was "the worst freeze-up in living memory", as the Sound itself never froze over completely, and the corner of it that did freeze did so very late in the winter. Aside from scrolling through satellite pictures, no one has yet undertaken a quantitative investigation of the underlying causes and effects of this anomalous year. I propose to use the past 15 years of satellite-based SST, Sea Ice, and visible imagery products along with ground-based Meteorological measurements to investigate the driving factors behind this anomaly and place it within the greater narrative of a warming Arctic and shrinking sea ice cover.

Intended data products:
MODIS SST: https://opendap.jpl.nasa.gov/opendap/OceanTemperature/modis/L3/aqua/11um/v2014.0/4km/daily/contents.html

Reynolds SST & Sea Ice Product: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/thredds/catalog/OisstBase/NetCDF/AVHRR/catalog.html

U Bremen AMSR Passive Microwave Sea Ice Product (ASI Algorithm): https://seaice.uni-bremen.de/data/

Visible Satellite Imagery: Landsat or MODIS, but I haven't yet found an elegant way of accessing either remotely that doesn't involve a huge download. 

Local Meteorological Data from OTZ airport: see 'otz-met-data.csv' in this repository.

I also have a 1-year timeseries from a mooring I installed at the edge of Kotzebue sound, which I would like to incorporate in this analysis if it ends up making sense. Unfortunately there are not any Argo floats in the Chukchi Sea, save a single one that started reporting recently in late 2018 which could be of some use.
